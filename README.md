The client provided one dataset, Online Retail.

The dataset has 9 columns namely,

The InvoiceNo column has the invoice number of each purchase made by customers. StockCode has the products stock code. Description has the products description and information. InvoiceDate has dates from when the purchase happened. UnitPrice has the price of the product. CustomerID tells us who purchased the product in numerical form. Country is where the customer resides in. We multiplied UnitPrice and Quantity to make the column Revenue to show insights for the client.

Before we begin the analysis, we must make sure the data is clean and without errors. We used Excel to clean the dataset with the following steps:

Removed Rows in the Quantity column showing negative numbers or below 1
Removed Rows in the UnitPrice column that are below $0
Removed Rows with blanks
Added Revenue Column from multipling UnitPrice with Quantity
